# fractal-melodies
Generates fractal melodies using the method described by Beauvois (2007), Music Perception. The R script generates a fractal time series, and then the Matlab script generates a MIDI sequence using that time series. The result is a melody with self-similar pitch fluctuations. Note: the Matlab script requires the MIDI Toolbox.
